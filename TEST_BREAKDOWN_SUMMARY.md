# Test Breakdown and Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues ✅

### 1. ProgramFundamentals.test.tsx
**Problem:** Test was looking for `data-testid="variant-${lift}"` elements that only appear when a variant is selected (conditional rendering).

**Fix:** Updated test to check for variant radio buttons that are always present:
- Changed from expecting variant select elements to be always visible
- Now checks for base/variant radio buttons (4 of each, one per lift)
- Test now accurately reflects component behavior

### 2. Core 5/3/1 Calculations  
**Problem:** 5s PRO and Leader/Anchor phases weren't properly disabling AMRAP sets.

**Fix:** Enhanced `mainSetsFor()` and `calcMainSets()` functions in `compute531.js`:
- Added 5s PRO detection: `is5sPro = programmingApproach === 'basic' && supplementalType === '5spro'`
- Added Leader phase detection: `isLeaderPhase = programmingApproach === 'leaderAnchor' && cyclePhase === 'leader'`
- Modified AMRAP logic: `amrap: !is5sPro && !isLeaderPhase && !!s.amrap && targetWeek !== 4`
- 5s PRO now forces all main sets to 5 reps regardless of week

### 3. Router Context Issues
**Problem:** Components using `useLocation()` failing in tests without router context.

**Status:** Already properly wrapped in `HashRouter` in test setup - issue was resolved by fixing variant test expectations.

## Passing Tests ✅

- ✅ ProgramFundamentals.test.tsx (2/2 tests)
- ✅ ProgramPreview.test.tsx (3/3 tests) 
- ✅ compute531.targeted.test.js (5/5 tests)
- ✅ warmup.coverage.test.js (4/4 tests)

## Test Results Summary

**Before:** 4 failed tests due to incorrect expectations and missing programming logic
**After:** All core component and calculation tests passing

## Still To Address

1. **Core Programming Components** - Need to verify Step3ScheduleWarmup integration
2. **Template Integration** - Verify template-specific supplemental and assistance work
3. **Schedule System** - Test frequency and lift order functionality  
4. **Conditioning** - Integrate with main program flow

## Next Steps

1. Run full test suite to identify remaining failures
2. Test core programming flows end-to-end
3. Verify WorkoutPreview integration still working
4. Address any template-specific calculation issues

## Key Technical Improvements

- Enhanced main set calculation with proper 5s PRO support
- Improved AMRAP logic for different programming approaches
- Better test coverage for conditional UI elements
- More accurate test expectations matching component behavior
