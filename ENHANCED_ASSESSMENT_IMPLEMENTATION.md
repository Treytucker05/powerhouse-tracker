# Enhanced Assessment Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the GoalsAndNeeds.jsx component with comprehensive assessment features including injury screening, gainer type testing, fiber dominance assessment, mileage evaluation, and SMART goals validation.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `/src/hooks/useAssessment.js` - New Assessment Hook
**Features:**
- Gainer type classification based on reps at 80% 1RM
- Muscle fiber dominance recommendations
- Training capacity (mileage) assessment
- SMART goals validation framework
- Assessment suggestions generation
- Supabase integration (commented out for setup)

### 2. `/src/components/program/tabs/GoalsAndNeeds.jsx` - Enhanced Component
**New Sections Added:**
- **Injury Screening**: Past injuries, current limitations, movement issues
- **Gainer Type Test**: 80% 1RM rep test with classification and recommendations
- **Fiber Dominance**: Muscle-specific fiber type assessment with training tips
- **Mileage Assessment**: Age group, training experience, recovery capacity
- **SMART Goals**: Structured goal setting with validation
- **Assessment Insights**: Dynamic suggestions based on responses

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Integration (Optional)
To enable database persistence, uncomment the Supabase code in `useAssessment.js`:

```javascript
// In src/hooks/useAssessment.js, uncomment lines 159-172
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabaseClient';

// Then uncomment the Supabase upsert code in saveAssessment function
```

### 2. Database Schema
Add this table to your Supabase database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_assessments (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  enhanced_assessment JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id)
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE user_assessments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for users to access their own assessments
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own assessments" ON user_assessments
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 3. Context Integration
The assessment data is automatically saved to AppContext. Make sure your AppContext supports the `UPDATE_ASSESSMENT` action.

## Component Features

### Injury Screening
- Checkbox selection for common injury areas
- Text areas for current limitations and movement issues
- Helps inform exercise selection and modifications

### Gainer Type Assessment
- Based on research from strength training literature
- Classifies users as Very Fast, Fast, Slow, or Very Slow gainers
- Provides specific volume and intensity recommendations

### Fiber Dominance
- Assesses hamstrings, quadriceps, and chest
- Provides training recommendations based on fiber type
- Helps optimize rep ranges and exercise selection

### Mileage/Capacity Assessment
- Considers age group, training experience, recovery capacity
- Provides capacity-based training recommendations
- Helps determine appropriate training loads

### SMART Goals Framework
- Structured goal setting with validation
- Ensures goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- Real-time validation feedback

## UI/UX Features

### Design System Integration
- Uses consistent red input backgrounds (`bg-red-600`)
- Gray card backgrounds (`bg-gray-700`, `bg-gray-600`)
- White text with proper contrast ratios
- Responsive grid layouts

### Interactive Elements
- Real-time classification updates
- Dynamic recommendations display
- Validation feedback
- Loading states for save operations

### Navigation
- Preserves existing navigation functionality
- Auto-saves assessment before proceeding to next step
- Manual save option available

## Usage

1. **Complete Basic Assessment**: Users should complete the basic assessment first
2. **Enhanced Assessment**: Fill out the new sections for comprehensive evaluation
3. **Review Insights**: Check the generated suggestions and recommendations
4. **Validate Goals**: Use SMART goals validation before proceeding
5. **Save & Continue**: Assessment auto-saves when proceeding to next step

## Customization

### Adding New Assessment Sections
1. Add new state to `enhancedAssessment` object
2. Create UI section in the component
3. Add logic to `useAssessment` hook
4. Update suggestions generation

### Modifying Recommendations
1. Edit the recommendation logic in `useAssessment.js`
2. Update the `classifyGainerType`, `getFiberRecommendations`, or `getMileageRecommendations` functions
3. Customize the suggestions generation

## Benefits

1. **Evidence-Based**: Incorporates research-backed assessment methods
2. **Comprehensive**: Covers injury, performance, and goal-setting aspects
3. **Actionable**: Provides specific training recommendations
4. **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with existing program design flow
5. **Scalable**: Easy to extend with additional assessment components

This enhanced assessment system transforms the basic goal setting into a comprehensive athlete evaluation that directly informs program design decisions.
