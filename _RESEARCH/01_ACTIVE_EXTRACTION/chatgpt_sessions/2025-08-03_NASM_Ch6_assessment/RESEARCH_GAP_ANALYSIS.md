*Assessment: Updated based on complete protocol extraction*

## ✅ COMPLETE EXTRACTION RECEIVED

### **Overhead Squat Assessment - COMPLETE**
**Source: NASM-CPT 7th Edition, pp. 139-142 (Verbatim extraction)**

#### **✅ Confirmed NASM Protocol Includes:**
- ✅ Feet shoulder-width apart, toes straight, shoes off
- ✅ Arms overhead, elbows fully extended, bisecting torso
- ✅ 5 repetitions, squat to chair height
- ✅ **Anterior view:** Feet/ankles/knees tracking over 2nd/3rd toe
- ✅ **Anterior compensations:** Feet flatten/turn out, knees move inward
- ✅ **Lateral view:** LPHC, shoulder, cervical complexes (tibia ≈ torso angle)
- ✅ **Lateral compensations:** Low back arches, excessive forward lean, arms fall forward
- ✅ Figure 6.36 checklist reference
- ✅ Table 6-12 muscle analysis reference

#### **❌ CONFIRMED NOT IN CORE NASM TEXT:**
- ❌ Arms down testing variation
- ❌ Heels elevated modification  
- ❌ Asymmetrical weight shift assessment
- ❌ Forward head posture cues
- ❌ Rounded shoulder assessments

**Note:** Missing variations likely from NASM workshops or supplementary resources

### **Single-Leg Squat Assessment - COMPLETE**
**Source: NASM-CPT 7th Edition, pp. 143-146 (Verbatim extraction)**

#### **✅ Confirmed NASM Protocol Includes:**
- ✅ Position: Hands on hips, eyes straight ahead, stance foot pointing straight
- ✅ Movement: Squat to comfortable level, up to 5 reps per side
- ✅ View: Observe knee from front - should track in line with foot (2nd-3rd toes)
- ✅ **Single compensation:** Knee moves inward (adduct & internally rotate)
- ✅ Modification: Single-leg balance assessment for elderly/difficult cases
- ✅ Figure 6.40 checklist reference
- ✅ Table 6-13 muscle analysis reference

#### **❌ CONFIRMED NOT IN CORE NASM TEXT:**
- ❌ Hip hike assessment (pelvis elevation on non-stance leg)
- ❌ Hip drop assessment (pelvis depression on stance leg)
- ❌ Trunk rotation evaluation
- ❌ Excessive forward lean assessment
- ❌ Foot positioning compensations
- ❌ Bilateral comparison methods
- ❌ Detailed population protocols

**Note:** Core NASM protocol focuses solely on knee valgus - other compensations from supplementary sources

### **Push/Pull Assessment - COMPLETE**
**Source: NASM-CPT 7th Edition, pp. 146-149 (Verbatim extraction)**

#### **✅ Confirmed NASM Protocol Includes:**
- ✅ **Pushing:** Split stance, core braced, toes forward, press handles from shoulder height
- ✅ **Pulling:** Feet shoulder-width, core braced, toes forward, pull handles to torso
- ✅ **Repetitions:** ≤20 controlled reps for both movements
- ✅ **Key Points:** Lumbar & cervical spines neutral, shoulders level throughout movement
- ✅ **Three compensations (both movements):** Low-back arches, shoulders elevate, head migrates/protrudes forward
- ✅ Tables 6-14 & 6-15 muscle analysis (same patterns for both movements)
- ✅ Machine option acceptable if standing position not possible

#### **✅ Confirmed Muscle Analysis Patterns:**
- ✅ **Low-back arches:** Hip flexors, Erector spinae ⬆ / Intrinsic core stabilizers ⬇
- ✅ **Shoulders elevate:** Upper traps, SCM, Levator scapulae ⬆ / Mid-lower traps ⬇  
- ✅ **Head forward:** Upper traps, SCM, Levator scapulae ⬆ / Deep cervical flexors ⬇

#### **❌ CONFIRMED NOT IN CORE NASM TEXT:**
- ❌ Scapular winging assessment
- ❌ Trunk rotation evaluation
- ❌ Weight shift compensations
- ❌ Left-right asymmetry flags
- ❌ ROM restriction guidelines

**Note:** Core NASM focuses on three primary compensations - additional assessments from supplementary sources

### **4. Population Modifications - Missing Elements**

#### **MISSING Detailed Protocols for:**
- ❌ **Pregnancy modifications** (2nd/3rd trimester specific)
- ❌ **Obesity modifications** (body composition considerations)
- ❌ **Elderly modifications** (balance vs. movement assessment)
- ❌ **Injury-specific modifications** (low back, shoulder, knee pain)
- ❌ **Athlete-specific considerations**
