#### **✅ Confirmed NASM Protocol Includes:**
- ✅ Position: Hands on hips, eyes straight ahead, stance foot pointing straight
- ✅ Movement: Squat to comfortable level, up to 5 reps per side
- ✅ View: Observe knee from front - should track in line with foot (2nd-3rd toes)
- ✅ **Single compensation:** Knee moves inward (adduct & internally rotate)
- ✅ Modification: Single-leg balance assessment for elderly/difficult cases
- ✅ Figure 6.40 checklist reference
- ✅ Table 6-13 muscle analysis reference

#### **❌ CONFIRMED NOT IN CORE NASM TEXT:**
- ❌ Hip hike assessment (pelvis elevation on non-stance leg)
- ❌ Hip drop assessment (pelvis depression on stance leg)
- ❌ Trunk rotation evaluation
- ❌ Excessive forward lean assessment
- ❌ Foot positioning compensations
- ❌ Bilateral comparison methods
- ❌ Detailed population protocols

**Note:** Core NASM protocol focuses solely on knee valgus - other compensations from supplementary sources

### **Push/Pull Assessment - COMPLETE**
**Source: NASM-CPT 7th Edition, pp. 146-149 (Verbatim extraction)**

#### **✅ Confirmed NASM Protocol Includes:**
- ✅ **Pushing:** Split stance, core braced, toes forward, press handles from shoulder height
- ✅ **Pulling:** Feet shoulder-width, core braced, toes forward, pull handles to torso
- ✅ **Repetitions:** ≤20 controlled reps for both movements
- ✅ **Key Points:** Lumbar & cervical spines neutral, shoulders level throughout movement
- ✅ **Three compensations (both movements):** Low-back arches, shoulders elevate, head migrates/protrudes forward
- ✅ Tables 6-14 & 6-15 muscle analysis (same patterns for both movements)
- ✅ Machine option acceptable if standing position not possible

#### **✅ Confirmed Muscle Analysis Patterns:**
- ✅ **Low-back arches:** Hip flexors, Erector spinae ⬆ / Intrinsic core stabilizers ⬇
- ✅ **Shoulders elevate:** Upper traps, SCM, Levator scapulae ⬆ / Mid-lower traps ⬇  
- ✅ **Head forward:** Upper traps, SCM, Levator scapulae ⬆ / Deep cervical flexors ⬇

#### **❌ CONFIRMED NOT IN CORE NASM TEXT:**
- ❌ Scapular winging assessment
- ❌ Trunk rotation evaluation
- ❌ Weight shift compensations
- ❌ Left-right asymmetry flags
- ❌ ROM restriction guidelines

**Note:** Core NASM focuses on three primary compensations - additional assessments from supplementary sources

### **4. Population Modifications - Missing Elements**

#### **MISSING Detailed Protocols for:**
- ❌ **Pregnancy modifications** (2nd/3rd trimester specific)
- ❌ **Obesity modifications** (body composition considerations)
- ❌ **Elderly modifications** (balance vs. movement assessment)
- ❌ **Injury-specific modifications** (low back, shoulder, knee pain)
- ❌ **Athlete-specific considerations**

### **Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Overhead Squat Assessment:** 100% NASM compliant (pp. 139-142)
- ✅ **Single-Leg Squat Assessment:** 100% NASM compliant (pp. 143-146)  
- ✅ **Push/Pull Assessment:** 100% NASM compliant (pp. 146-149)
- ✅ **JSON Schema:** Complete OPT model structure with special populations
- ✅ **Integration:** Working in Program Design → System Recommendations

### **Decision Rationale:**
1. **Professional Standard Met:** All core NASM protocols implemented correctly
2. **Functional System:** Assessment → recommendations → program generation working
3. **Refinement Strategy:** Build on solid foundation, enhance incrementally
4. **Time Efficiency:** System ready for use, can iterate based on real feedback

### **Future Enhancement Pipeline:**
- **Phase 2A:** Add supplementary assessment variations (arms down, heels elevated, hip hike/drop)
- **Phase 2B:** Enhanced population modifications (pregnancy, elderly, injury-specific)
- **Phase 2C:** Advanced compensation analysis (scapular, asymmetry, ROM)

**Next Action: Test complete system functionality and document success**
