## üéØ **EXTRACTION PROMPT (READY TO COPY)**

**Copy this exact prompt into ChatGPT:**

```
I'm analyzing NASM Chapter 6 for integration into PowerHouse Tracker. Extract ALL information about the Overhead Squat Assessment:

**ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL:**
- Complete setup requirements (space, equipment, positioning)
- Client preparation instructions (warm-up, clothing, instructions)
- Step-by-step execution procedure (exact sequence)
- Viewing angles and what to observe from each position
- Movement phases and what to assess during each phase
- Repetition count and timing requirements
- Documentation method and scoring system

**COMPENSATION PATTERNS:**
- All movement compensations that can be observed
- What each compensation indicates (muscle imbalances)
- Probable overactive muscles for each compensation
- Probable underactive muscles for each compensation
- Risk factors associated with each compensation

**CORRECTIVE STRATEGIES:**
- Recommended corrective exercises for each compensation
- Exercise progressions and regressions
- Integration recommendations with training programs
- Timeline expectations for improvement

**PRACTICAL APPLICATION:**
- When and how often to perform assessment
- Client education and explanation methods
- How to track progress over time
- Referral guidelines for serious issues

Include exact page numbers, tables, charts, and any visual assessment guides.

## üÜò **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If ChatGPT Can't Read PDF:**
- Try uploading just the relevant pages (Chapter 6)
- Compress PDF if file size is too large
- Try different browser (Chrome/Firefox)
- Alternative: Convert PDF pages to images

### **If Extraction is Incomplete:**
- Run follow-up prompt: "Please provide more detail about [specific area]"
- Ask for specific page numbers: "What page numbers cover this topic?"
- Request tables/charts: "Are there any assessment charts or scoring tables?"

### **If Quality is Low:**
- Try more specific prompts focusing on single topics
- Request examples: "Provide specific examples of movement compensations"
- Ask for implementation details: "How would this be implemented practically?"
