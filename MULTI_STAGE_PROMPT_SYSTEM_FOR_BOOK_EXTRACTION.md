# üìö MULTI-STAGE PROMPT SYSTEM FOR FITNESS BOOK EXTRACTION
*Created: August 1, 2025*
*Purpose: Senior PM solution for systematic extraction of training knowledge from PDFs/books*

## üéØ **CORE PROBLEM SOLUTION**

### **Why Single Mega-Prompts Fail:**
- ‚ùå Token limits prevent comprehensive analysis
- ‚ùå Context degradation reduces accuracy
- ‚ùå Difficult to track progress across large documents
- ‚ùå Can't iterate effectively on complex topics
- ‚ùå Information gets lost in massive responses

### **‚úÖ Solution: Systematic Prompt Chain**
Break down extraction into focused, manageable stages that build comprehensive knowledge systematically.

1. KEY TAKEAWAYS (3-5 main points)
2. UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS (not found elsewhere)
3. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
4. INTEGRATION NOTES (how this fits with other systems)
5. CRITICAL DATA POINTS (numbers, ratios, standards)

Format for database entry.
```
