# Module 7: Storyframe Protocol

## Purpose
Document a repeatable process to capture the user's intent, assign ownership, and translate ideas into a coherent storyframe that can be synchronized across the program.

## Triggers
- A new storyframe is requested by the user or team.
- Existing narrative needs refinement or expansion.
- Program elements require alignment with a refreshed story hook or thematic direction.

## Six-Step Flow
1. **Core System** — Confirm the current objective, constraints, and success metrics for the storyframe.
2. **Roles** — Identify the owner, contributors, and reviewers accountable for the storyframe deliverable.
3. **Narrative** — Capture the storyline, tone, and key beats that define the user experience.
4. **Hooks** — Surface the attention-grabbing angles, promises, or emotional drivers that anchor the story.
5. **Framework Sync** — Align the storyframe with existing program frameworks, templates, and dependencies.
6. **Export Cards (tagged `Storyframe`)** — Generate structured cards or tasks labeled `Storyframe` for implementation and tracking.

## Outcome
A clearly defined storyframe with owners, narrative direction, and implementation cards ready for execution and alignment across the program.
