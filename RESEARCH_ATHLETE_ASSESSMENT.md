# Research Notes: Athlete Assessment & Goal Setting in Macrocycle Design

## Sources
- NSCA: Hierarchical Structure of Periodization Cycles – Goals drive all levels; assess athlete/team needs.
- TrainingPeaks: Macrocycles Explained – Annual plan blocks based on specific goals; assess recovery needs.
- NASM: Periodization Simplified – Evaluate current fitness, set phase-specific goals (e.g., build foundation in preparatory phase).
- NSCA PDFs: Emphasize matching training to job/sport demands, considering injuries and status.

## Key Methodologies
- **Assessment Steps**: Evaluate biomotor abilities (strength, power, endurance), training history, injury risk, and sport-specific demands.
- **Goal Setting**: Use SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals. Long-term (1-4 years) tied to peaks/competitions.
- **Integration with Macrocycle**: Goals determine phase structure (e.g., high volume for novices in preparatory phase).
- **Acute Variables**: Suggest based on assessment (e.g., lower intensity for beginners: 3-5 sets, 8-12 reps, 60-70% 1RM).

## Examples
- Novice: Goal = Build base strength; Macrocycle starts with general prep phase.
- Advanced: Goal = Multiple peaks; Assess for overtraining risks.
