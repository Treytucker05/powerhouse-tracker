# Program Design System Analysis & Navigation Guide

## Current Status: Multiple Implementations Detected

Based on our analysis, there are multiple program design implementations in your workspace. Here's what we've discovered:

## üéØ IDENTIFIED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. **Source Code Implementation** (`src/pages/Program.jsx`)
- **Location:** `src/pages/Program.jsx`
- **5-Tab System:** Overview ‚Üí Block Sequencing ‚Üí Loading Parameters ‚Üí Training Methods ‚Üí Program Preview
- **Status:** This is what we've been modifying
- **Access:** Via React Router at `/program`

### 2. **Built/Production Implementation** (`docs/index.html`)
- **Location:** Built files in `docs/` folder
- **Interface:** Matches your screenshots with "Goals Summary", "Assessment Summary"
- **Status:** This appears to be what you're currently viewing
- **Access:** Via static HTML file or GitHub Pages

### 3. **Enhanced Assessment Implementation** 
- **Location:** `src/components/program/tabs/EnhancedAssessmentGoals.jsx`
- **Features:** Goals & Needs Assessment, Program Overview tabs
- **Status:** Alternative implementation

### 4. **Fitness Tracker Implementation**
- **Location:** `fitness-tracker/` directory
- **Status:** Separate implementation

## üîç TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONE YOU'RE USING

### Check Your Browser URL:
- **If URL contains `localhost:5173` or `localhost:3000`:** You're using the development server (src/ implementation)
- **If URL contains `/docs/` or ends with `.html`:** You're using the built version
- **If URL shows a GitHub Pages domain:** You're using the deployed built version

### Visual Indicators:
- **Source Implementation:** Clean React interface with modern tabs
- **Built Implementation:** Contains "Program Design - Complete Edition", "Goals Summary", "Assessment Summary"

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

Please check your browser URL and tell me:
1. What is the full URL you're currently viewing?
2. Are you running `npm start` or `npm run dev`?
3. Or are you opening an HTML file directly?

This will help us identify exactly which implementation needs the navigation fix.

## üõ†Ô∏è NEXT STEPS

Once we identify the correct implementation:
1. **If Built Version:** We need to rebuild after fixing source code
2. **If Source Version:** We can continue with our current fixes
3. **If Different Implementation:** We need to locate and modify the correct files

## üìã COMPONENT INVENTORY

### Program Design Related Files Found:
- `src/pages/Program.jsx` - Main 5-tab system
- `src/components/program/tabs/ProgramOverview.jsx` - Overview tab component
- `src/components/program/tabs/GoalsAndNeeds.jsx` - Goals assessment
- `src/components/program/tabs/EnhancedAssessmentGoals.jsx` - Enhanced assessment
- Plus 30+ other program-related components

### Key Observation:
The interface in your screenshots doesn't exactly match any single source file we've found, suggesting it might be:
1. A built/compiled version
2. A different branch or version
3. A combination of multiple components

**üö® PRIORITY:** Please confirm your current URL so we can fix the correct implementation!
