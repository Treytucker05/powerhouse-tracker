## WRAP Outputs
- Hooks
- Analogies
- Definitions
- Application prompts

### Card Export (Optional)
When WRAP produces hooks, analogies, or definitions, offer to export them as flashcards in CSV format with the columns **Front | Back | Tags | Hook**. Save the file to `/mnt/data/[Course_Topic_Date].csv` so learners can download the generated cards for review.
