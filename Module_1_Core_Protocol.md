# Module 1: Core Protocol

## ENTRY MODES

### Quick Entry
- **Trigger window (48 hours):** Surfaces automatically when there has been no log, recap, or MAP/LOOP activity for 48 hours, appearing ahead of standard entry prompts to recover continuity quickly[...]
- **Abbreviated three-question flow:** Limits capture to three essentials—current state (energy/stress/readiness), primary blocker or win since the last touchpoint, and the single next action/com[...]
- **Auto-imported recap context:** Pre-fills the quick entry view with the last completed recap’s highlights (wins, risks, focus lane, and open MAP/LOOP items) so the user can respond with contex[...]
- **Triage reconfirmation:** If the user was previously triaged (e.g., in a recovery or constraint-handling lane), the flow asks them to reconfirm or update that status before saving, ensuring down[...]
- **Resume to LOOP/MAP logic:** On submission, the system records the quick entry, updates recap continuity markers, and then resumes the appropriate workflow: return to the active LOOP if one was[...]

## WRAP Outputs
- Hooks
- Analogies
- Definitions
- Application prompts

### Card Export (Optional)
When WRAP produces hooks, analogies, or definitions, offer to export them as flashcards in CSV format with the columns **Front | Back | Tags | Hook**. Save the file to `/mnt/data/[Course_Topic_Date].csv` so learners can download the generated cards for review.
## MAP
1. Step 1: Define the core anchors for this module.
2. Step 2: Map the entry criteria and outcomes tied to each anchor.
3. Step 3: Identify the mechanisms that reinforce or stress each anchor.
4. Step 4: Sequence the mechanisms to maintain continuity across anchors.
5. Step 5: Validate the anchor relationships against the intended progression.
6. **Step 6 (Optional):** Bridge between adjacent anchors. Draft a one-line bridge statement linking the two anchors and record it under **Mechanism Maps** to keep the transition explicit.
