# Module 1: Core Protocol

## MAP
1. Step 1: Define the core anchors for this module.
2. Step 2: Map the entry criteria and outcomes tied to each anchor.
3. Step 3: Identify the mechanisms that reinforce or stress each anchor.
4. Step 4: Sequence the mechanisms to maintain continuity across anchors.
5. Step 5: Validate the anchor relationships against the intended progression.
6. **Step 6 (Optional):** Bridge between adjacent anchors. Draft a one-line bridge statement linking the two anchors and record it under **Mechanism Maps** to keep the transition explicit.
