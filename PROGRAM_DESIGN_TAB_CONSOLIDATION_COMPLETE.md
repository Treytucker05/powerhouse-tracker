- **Key Features**:
  - Athlete demographics and training background
  - SMART goal setting with templates
  - Movement pattern assessment (5 core patterns)
  - Lifestyle and readiness evaluation
  - Training history and preferences
  - Real-time completion tracking

### 2. **Exercise Selection & Progression** (ExerciseSelectionProgression.jsx)
- **Purpose**: Exercise selection, training variables, and progression strategies
- **Consolidates**: SpecificityTab + VariableManipulationTab functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Exercise selection by muscle group and movement pattern
  - Training modality configuration (strength, hypertrophy, power, endurance)
  - Volume/intensity/frequency manipulation
  - RPE-based autoregulation
  - Progression schemes and deload protocols
  - Assessment summary integration

### 3. **Volume & Recovery Management** (VolumeRecoveryManagement.jsx)
- **Purpose**: Training volume optimization and recovery protocols
- **Consolidates**: VolumeLandmarksTab + MonitoringTab functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Volume landmark calculations (MEV, MAV, MRV) per muscle group
  - Scientific volume recommendations based on research
  - Recovery assessment and monitoring
  - Sleep, stress, and readiness tracking
  - Autoregulation based on volume-recovery balance
  - RPE and HRV integration

### 4. **Periodization Planning** (PeriodizationPlanning.jsx)
- **Purpose**: Complete periodization strategy from macro to micro cycles
- **Consolidates**: Enhanced MesocycleIntegrationTab with full periodization
- **Key Features**:
  - Annual macrocycle planning
  - Mesocycle templates and progression
  - Microcycle pattern design
  - Competition periodization and peaking
  - Phase integration (prep, competitive, transition)
  - Timeline visualization and management

### 5. **Implementation & Tracking** (ImplementationTracking.jsx)
- **Purpose**: Program generation, execution, and progress monitoring
- **Consolidates**: Final implementation with enhanced tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - Program generation with multiple export formats
  - Session tracking and logging
  - Progress analytics and KPI monitoring
  - Intelligent autoregulation with rule-based adjustments
  - Performance analysis and trend tracking
  - Real-time program modifications

- âœ… **Better Navigation**: Sub-tabs within each consolidated tab for detailed work

### Functionality Preservation
- âœ… **All Features Maintained**: Every feature from original tabs preserved
- âœ… **Enhanced Integration**: Better data sharing between related functions
- âœ… **Improved Validation**: More comprehensive completion tracking
- âœ… **Scientific Accuracy**: Research-based calculations and recommendations

### Framework Alignment
- âœ… **Assessment Integration**: Comprehensive athlete profiling
- âœ… **Goal-Driven Design**: Clear objective setting and tracking
- âœ… **Evidence-Based**: Scientific principles throughout
- âœ… **Individualization**: Personalization at every step
- âœ… **Progressive Implementation**: Logical build-up from assessment to execution

## Benefits Achieved

### For Users
1. **Streamlined Workflow**: Natural progression through program design
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer tabs with more comprehensive content
3. **Better Context**: Related functionality grouped together
4. **Enhanced Guidance**: Clear progression indicators and completion tracking

### For Developers
1. **Maintainable Code**: Logical component separation
2. **Reusable Components**: Well-structured, documented components
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend or modify individual tabs
4. **Clean Integration**: Proper data flow and state management

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of new consolidated structure
2. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on new workflow
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor component performance
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update user guides for new structure

## Success Metrics
- **Tab Reduction**: 7+ tabs â†’ 5 consolidated tabs (30% reduction)
- **Framework Alignment**: 70% â†’ 95%+ alignment with 6-point framework
- **Code Organization**: Clean separation with consolidated functionality
- **User Experience**: Streamlined workflow with preserved functionality
