# Runtime Prompt

## Introduction
- Supports **Quick Entry Mode** for rapid logging without leaving the runtime view.
- Offers a **Mini-Recap option** to summarize key actions or changes before advancing.
- Enables **Anki Export during WRAP**, so spaced-repetition decks stay synchronized with the latest updates.
- Allows optional **Storyframe integration** when narrative guidance is helpful, without altering the standard runtime flow.

## Runtime Structure
- Maintain the existing runtime stages and controls while layering in the enhanced options above.
- Keep default prompts, ordering, and interaction patterns intact to avoid disrupting established workflows.
- Use feature toggles to enable or disable Quick Entry, Mini-Recap, Anki Export, and Storyframe support per session needs.

## Notes
- Document any new toggles or defaults in the runtime settings reference.
- When adding integrations, ensure core runtime performance remains unaffected.
