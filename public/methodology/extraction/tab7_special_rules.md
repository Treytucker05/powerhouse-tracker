# Tab 7 — Special Rules (Summary)

Source: `tab7_special_rules.csv`

- Training Max (TM): start light. Use ~85–90% of true/estimated 1RM so bar speed, technique, and recovery stay on track (e.g., e1RM 350 → TM 315 @ 90% or 295 @ 85%).
- 7th Week options — Deload: 70%x5, 80%x3–5, 90%x1, 100%(TM)x1. Slot between Leader → Anchor or whenever you need a break.
- 7th Week options — TM Test: 70x5, 80x5, 90x5, 100%(TM) x 3–5. If the 3–5 set is too hard, TM is too high — adjust downward.
- 7th Week options — PR Test: 70x5, 80x5, 90x5, 100%(TM) x PR/goal. Use sparingly as a competitive/test week.
- Leader/Anchor cadence: strictly 2 Leaders → 1 Anchor. Example: run 5x5/3/1 (Leader) for 2 cycles, then 7th Week, then Original 5/3/1 (Anchor).
- Template TM cap (5x5/3/1): cap TM at ~80% to preserve bar speed and recovery during high-volume Leaders.
- Conditioning — easy is mandatory: keep regular, easy aerobic work (walk/AirDyne/vest) 20–40 min, 3–5 days/week for health and recovery.
- Conditioning — hard days are capped: align intensity/volume with the template so progress isn’t taxed by conditioning excess.
- Conditioning — 50% rule: train, don’t test. Do the same hard work a bit slower or lighter (e.g., if best Prowler is 10×40 yd in 15 min, train it in ~20 min or reduce load).
- Daily prep: do ~10 minutes of mobility and 10–20 total jumps/throws in warm‑ups (e.g., box jumps + med‑ball throws) to stay athletic.
