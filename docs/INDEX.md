## üß≠ How to use this hub

- Prefer one canonical doc per topic to avoid drift.
- If you find overlap, propose a merge in docs/docs-audit.md; place merged drafts under docs/merge-drafts/.
- When a merge is approved, archive superseded docs into docs/archive/ rather than deleting immediately.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Active consolidation work

- E2E testing and coverage guidance has been unified into a single draft: docs/merge-drafts/E2E_TESTING_MERGED.md
- Pending merges listed in docs/docs-audit.md (Keep / Merge / Archive / Delete recommendations)

---

Maintainers: update this hub whenever a canonical doc changes, and reflect merges/archives in docs/docs-audit.md.
