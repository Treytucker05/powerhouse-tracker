## 📊 **DEMO RESULTS** (Live Testing Completed)

### **SRN Analysis Example**
```
User Goal: Hypertrophy
✅ SPECIFICITY: RP, bodybuilding, high_volume systems
✅ RECOVERY: Intermediate = weekly waves, every 4 weeks deload
✅ NOVELTY: Base phase = exercise variation strategy
```

### **Wave Progression Example** 
```
Volumizing Wave (225lb bench):
Week 1: 3×10 @ 158lbs (70%) = 4,740lbs tonnage
Week 2: 4×8 @ 163lbs (72.5%) = 5,216lbs tonnage  
Week 3: 5×6 @ 169lbs (75%) = 5,070lbs tonnage
```

### **RP Hypertrophy Program**
```
📋 Program Type: RP Hypertrophy with Bromley Waves
🎯 Goal: muscle_hypertrophy
⏱️ Duration: 8 weeks
📊 Volume Landmarks: MEV: 12, MAV: 22, MRV: 30 sets/week
🌊 Wave Structure: 2 complete volumizing waves
```
