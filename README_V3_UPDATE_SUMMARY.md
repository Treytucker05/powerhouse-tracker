### 2. **7-Step Periodization Methodology** ⭐ **NEW**
Completely updated Program Design workflow from 5-tab to 7-step evidence-based methodology:

#### Previous (v2.0.0): 5-Tab System
- 📋 Overview → 🔄 Block Sequencing → ⚙️ Loading Parameters → 💪 Training Methods → 👁️ Program Preview

#### New (v3.0.0): 7-Step Evidence-Based System
- 🎯 **Goals & Needs Assessment**: Athlete evaluation and objective setting
- 📅 **Macrocycle Structure**: Annual planning and periodization model selection
- 🔄 **Phase Design**: Preparatory, competitive, and transition phases
- 📊 **Mesocycle Planning**: Training block design with specific adaptations
- 📋 **Microcycle Design**: Weekly patterns and loading schemes
- 🏃 **Session & Monitoring**: Daily templates and progress tracking
- 🚀 **Implementation**: Execution strategies and program refinement

### 3. **Centralized Design System** ⭐ **NEW MAJOR FEATURE**
Added comprehensive documentation for the new design system:

#### Architecture Documentation
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Complete explanation of centralized color management
- **React Component Library**: Documentation of pre-built components
- **Theme Configuration**: Guide to theme switching and customization
- **Usage Patterns**: Three different ways to use the design system

#### Implementation Examples
```jsx
// Before: Manual Tailwind classes
<input className="w-full px-3 py-2 bg-red-600 border border-gray-500..." />

// After: Design system class
<input className="form-input" />
```

#### Benefits Highlighted
- **Global Control**: Change `--input-bg` once, updates ALL inputs
- **Consistency**: No more manual color overrides
- **Maintainability**: Centralized design decisions
- **Theme Switching**: Easy color scheme changes

### 4. **Technical Architecture Updates**

- Added separate state objects for each step:
  - `goalsAndNeeds`
  - `macrocycleStructure`
  - `phaseDesign`
  - `mesocyclePlanning`
  - `microcycleDesign`
  - `sessionMonitoring`
  - `implementation`
- Updated action creators for new methodology
- Maintained legacy support for backward compatibility

### 5. **Design System Integration**

#### UI Design Section
- Added comprehensive design system architecture documentation
- Included CSS custom properties examples
- Documented React component usage patterns
- Added theme switching examples

#### Navigation Updates
- Updated Program Design interface diagram for 7-step system

- Documented CSS custom property fallbacks
- Included migration troubleshooting

### 7. **Additional Resources & Documentation**
- Added design system documentation references
- Included new file locations for design system components
- Added migration examples showing before/after code
- Updated external resources with design system guides

### 8. **Footer & Version Information**
- Updated to reflect v3.0.0 with key features listed
- Added design system and 7-step methodology highlights
- Enhanced feature list with modern technology stack

## 🎯 Key Messaging Changes

### Primary Value Proposition
**Before**: "Complete program design system with professional dark theme"
**After**: "7-Step periodization with centralized design system"

### Core Benefits Emphasized
1. **Evidence-Based Methodology**: Sports science-backed 7-step approach
2. **Global Color Control**: "Set it and forget it" styling management
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Aggressive CSS overrides for consistency
4. **Modern Technology Stack**: React 19, Vite 6, CSS Custom Properties

### Developer Experience
- **Simplified Styling**: One class instead of complex Tailwind combinations
- **Centralized Control**: Change one variable, update entire application
- **Component Library**: Pre-built components for rapid development
- **Theme Switching**: Easy color scheme management

## 🔧 Backward Compatibility

### Legacy Support Maintained
- Old 5-tab system state structure preserved in `programData`
- Legacy routes still functional (`/program-design`)
- Existing Tailwind classes continue to work alongside design system
- Gradual migration path documented

### Migration Strategy
- Three usage options provided (CSS classes, React components, enhanced pages)
- Before/after examples for common patterns
- Troubleshooting guide for common migration issues
- Progressive enhancement approach

## ✅ Quality Assurance

### Documentation Consistency
- All section headers updated to reflect new methodology
- Consistent terminology throughout (7-step, design system, etc.)
- Updated code examples to match current implementation
- Cross-references between sections maintained

### Technical Accuracy
- State management documentation matches actual implementation
- Component examples reflect actual file structure
- Route configuration matches application setup
- Design system examples use correct class names and properties

## 🚀 Impact Summary

This README update transforms the documentation from a 5-tab program builder to a comprehensive 7-step evidence-based periodization system with centralized design management. The documentation now accurately reflects:
