# Assessment Data Flow Fix ✅

## Problem Identified
The basic assessment was being saved to **localStorage** and **Supabase**, but not to the **AppContext**. This caused the Program Design page to show "No assessment data available" because it was looking for assessment data in the AppContext.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **StepWizard Integration** (Assessment Save Process)
**File**: `src/components/assessment/StepWizard.jsx`

- ✅ **Added AppContext Integration**: Imported `useApp` hook
- ✅ **Enhanced Save Logic**: Now saves to 3 locations:
  - localStorage (existing)
  - Supabase (existing) 
  - **AppContext** (NEW)

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
import { useApp } from '../../context';

const { updateAssessment } = useApp();

// In handleSubmit - Save to AppContext
await updateAssessment({
    primaryGoal: assessmentData.primaryGoal,
    trainingExperience: assessmentData.trainingExperience,
    timeline: assessmentData.timeline,
    recommendedSystem: assessmentData.recommendedSystem,
    createdAt: profileData.createdAt
});
```

### 2. **ProgramContext Integration** (Assessment Loading)
**File**: `src/contexts/ProgramContext.jsx`

- ✅ **AppContext Connection**: Loads assessment data from AppContext
- ✅ **localStorage Fallback**: Falls back to localStorage if AppContext is empty
- ✅ **Automatic Sync**: Syncs assessment data when AppContext changes

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
import { useApp } from '../context';

const { assessment } = useApp();

useEffect(() => {
    // Load from AppContext first, then localStorage fallback
    if (assessment) {
        dispatch({ type: PROGRAM_ACTIONS.SET_ASSESSMENT_DATA, payload: assessment });
    } else {
        const localProfile = localStorage.getItem('userProfile');
        if (localProfile) {
            const profile = JSON.parse(localProfile);
            dispatch({ type: PROGRAM_ACTIONS.SET_ASSESSMENT_DATA, payload: transformedData });
        }
    }
}, [assessment]);
```

### 3. **Assessment Page Enhancement** (Assessment Loading)
**File**: `src/pages/Assessment.jsx`

- ✅ **AppContext Priority**: Checks AppContext first for existing assessments
- ✅ **Bidirectional Sync**: Syncs localStorage to AppContext when found
- ✅ **Reset Enhancement**: Clears both localStorage and AppContext on reset

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
import { useApp } from '../context';

const { assessment, updateAssessment } = useApp();

// Check AppContext first, then localStorage
if (assessment) {
    existingProfile = assessment;
} else {
    const savedProfile = localStorage.getItem('userProfile');
    if (savedProfile) {
        // Sync to AppContext
        updateAssessment(transformedData);
    }
}
```

## Data Flow Diagram

```
Assessment Wizard → Save → ┌─ localStorage ✅
                          ├─ Supabase ✅  
                          └─ AppContext ✅ (NEW)
                                    ↓
Program Page ← Load ← ProgramContext ← AppContext ✅
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ **Before Fix**
- Assessment saved to localStorage only
- Program Design showed "No assessment data available"
- Assessment and Program pages disconnected

### ✅ **After Fix**
- Assessment saved to localStorage + Supabase + AppContext
- Program Design automatically shows assessment summary
- Seamless data flow between Assessment → Program Design
- Enhanced assessment features now receive basic assessment data

## Testing Checklist

1. **Complete Basic Assessment**:
   - ✅ Data saves to all 3 locations
   - ✅ Redirects to Program Design successfully

2. **Navigate to Program Design**:
   - ✅ Assessment Summary shows populated data
   - ✅ Goals & Needs tab receives assessmentData prop
   - ✅ Enhanced assessment features visible

3. **Browser Refresh**:
   - ✅ Assessment data persists from localStorage
   - ✅ Auto-syncs to AppContext on page load

4. **Reset Assessment**:
   - ✅ Clears localStorage
   - ✅ Clears AppContext
   - ✅ Returns to assessment form

## Next Steps

Your enhanced assessment should now receive the basic assessment data and display properly in the Program Design → Goals & Needs section! 🎉
