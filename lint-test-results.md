# Test Results

## Before the fix (simulated)
- lint:ci with warnings would fail CI with exit code 1
- Command: `eslint "src/**/*.{js,jsx}" --max-warnings 0`

## After the fix
- lint:ci with warnings passes with exit code 0
- Command: `eslint "src/**/*.{js,jsx}"`

### tracker-ui:
```
$ npm run lint:ci
> tracker-ui@0.0.0 lint:ci
> eslint "src/**/*.{js,jsx}"

/home/runner/work/powerhouse-tracker/powerhouse-tracker/tracker-ui/src/context/trainingStateContext.jsx
  6:14  warning  Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Move your React context(s) to a separate file  react-refresh/only-export-components

✖ 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)

Exit code: 0 ✅ (Previously would have been 1 ❌)
```

### tracker-ui-clean:
```
$ npm run lint:ci
> tracker-ui@0.0.0 lint:ci
> eslint "src/**/*.{js,jsx}"

/home/runner/work/powerhouse-tracker/powerhouse-tracker/tracker-ui-clean/tracker-ui/src/components/dashboard/UpcomingSessionsPreview.jsx
  7:39  error  'index' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars

/home/runner/work/powerhouse-tracker/powerhouse-tracker/tracker-ui-clean/tracker-ui/src/context/trainingStateContext.jsx
  401:17  warning  Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Use a new file to share constants or functions between components  react-refresh/only-export-components

✖ 2 problems (1 error, 1 warning)

Exit code: 1 ❌ (Still fails because of actual error, not warning)
```

## Summary
✅ Warnings no longer cause CI failure
✅ Errors still cause CI failure (as expected)
✅ Regular lint script works the same way
✅ Only the specific lint:ci scripts were modified
